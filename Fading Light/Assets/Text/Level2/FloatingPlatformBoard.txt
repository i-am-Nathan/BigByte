PB::Beware fellow adventurers.
PB::Ahead lies where many have "Fallen".
PB::Both players must be on the platform and interact with it to allow the platform to move and lock the players on the platform.
PB::Player 1 (Little Sibling) press "O" to lock and unlock on the platform. While locked, press left and right arrow keys to rotate the platform.
PB::Player 2 (Big Sibling) press "Q" to lock and unlock on the platform. While locked, press "W" and "S" to move forward and backwards on the platform.
PB::Platform will only be able to move when both players are locked on the platform.
PB::Good Luck.
