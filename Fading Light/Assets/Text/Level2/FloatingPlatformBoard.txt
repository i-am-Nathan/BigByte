PB::Beware fellow adventurers.
PB::Ahead lies where many have "Fallen".
PB::Both players must be on the platform and interact with it to activate the platform.
PB::Player 1 press "Q" to mount and unmount the platform. While mounted, press left and right arrow to rotate platform.
PB::Player 2 press "O" to mount and unmount the platform. While mounted, press "W" and "S" to move forward and backwards on the platform.
PB::If one player stops interacting with the platform, it will stop in place.
PB::Good Luck.
