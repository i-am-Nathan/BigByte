MM:Psssssssssssssssssst 
MM:Come here
MM:Hello young travellers, welcome to my humble abode
MM:They call me the Mole Man and I am the ruler of this cave
LS:Eeek I'm scared sis
BS:Don't worry "INSERTNAMEHERE", someone will come looking for us
MM:Don't be scared child, I won't hurt you
BS:Mr Mole Man, would you be so kind to direct us out of this cave
MM:Hehe, one does not simply leave this cave so easily
MM:You shall pass the trials present in my domain
MM:Luxury and freedom awaits those who accomplish such feats
MM:Your journey will only go as far as your teamwork and COLLABORATION ( GAME CONCEPT BOIS )
BS:If we refuse?
MM:Wait all you want, lingering on to the foolish dreams that someone will find you
MM:Before you know it, the spiders will eat you up
LS:*Sob Sob Sob*
BS:Don't worry "INSERTNAMEHERE", everything will work out.
MM:I the Mole Man am not so cruel to not provide a bit of aid.
MM:Here is a magical torch, it will scare away "most" monsters in this domain
MM:Do not leave its light unless you want to die
MM:The torch is enchanted and its flame can regenerate through the different power sources lying around.
MM:Good luck young ones, I am expecting big things from you
