MM:!!
MM:Hello young children, welcome to my humble abode. They call me the Mole Man and I am the ruler of this cave.
MM:How did you get here, little kiddies?
LS:Eeek I'm scared sis. He looks weird.
BS:Don't worry "INSERTNAMEHERE", mom and dad will come looking for us.
MM:Don't be scared children, I won't hurt you.
LS:Excuse me Mole Man, would you be so kind to direct us out of this cave. We entered into this cave and suddenly the cave started to collapse.
MM:Its because of me you are trape.......
MM:I mean, Ohh thats so scary you two being here in this cave alone in the dark, with all of these spiders, monsters, traps and creatures of the dark.
MM:Its a good thing you found the torch I left yo......
MM:I mean ur lucky you found a torch to keep the darkness away.
LS:"INSERTNAMEHERE" are we going to die in this cave with this man.
MM:ITS MOLE MAN!!
MM:I mean, its Mole Man little childrens.
BS:No "INSERTNAMEHERE", we are going to escape and get out of this place.
MM:I know the way out little kiddies.
BS:How can we escape Rat Man.
MM: ITS MOLE MAN!!
MM:I am a MOLE MAN little children.
LS:I want to go home. Just let us go home please.
MM:Hehe, one does not simply leave this cave so easily. You shall leave only if you pass the trials present in my domain.
MM:Luxury and freedom awaits those who accomplish such feats. Will glory be awarded to one of you two, or is your bond strong enough to escape this place.
BS:If we refuse?
MM:Wait all you want, lingering on to the foolish dreams that someone will find you. Before you know it, the spiders will eat you up, and I will be waiting.
LS:*Sob Sob Sob*, this Mole Man will kill us.
BS:Don't worry "INSERTNAMEHERE", everything will work out.
MM:HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!! (runs away)
